# Attendance Settings

### Overview

Attendance is a fundamental feature in any work system, as it records attendance and compiles data for record-keeping.

This section provides customization options for various features, including office timings, multiple clock-ins, late mark time limits, working days, and clock in/clock out details.

- **Office Timings**: This includes specifying the start time, end time, and half-day leave mark. It also allows you to set an extra time slot for late marking and define the maximum number of clock-ins allowed in a day.
- **Working Days**: You can designate the active days of the week that employees are expected to work on. This ensures that the clock in/out feature is active only on the specified working days, treating the rest as holidays.
- **Clock In/Clock Out Methods**: Choose whether clock in and clock out should be location-restricted, IP-restricted, or both. You can also decide if self clock in/clock out is allowed.

Customizing these attendance settings helps manage employee attendance effectively and ensures accurate record-keeping.
