- **Contract Prefix**: A specific prefix added to each contract number, such as "CONT" for contracts.
- **Contract Number Separator**: A character like "#" used to separate the prefix and the contract number.
- **Contract Number Digits**: The number of digits in the contract number, which can be set to 3 in this example.
- **Contract Number Example**: An example contract number following the defined format, like "CONT#001".

These settings help maintain consistency and organization in contract management.
