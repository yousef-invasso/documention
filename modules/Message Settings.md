# Message Settings

**Message Settings** are a crucial aspect of the system. Messaging facilitates effective communication among team members, clients, and administrators, enhancing task management and overall productivity. This setting allows you to choose which message channels should be active or inactive, depending on the organization's specific needs.

One key choice is whether clients can directly communicate with administrators or employees and vice versa. This decision determines the level of interaction permitted between clients and the internal team, shaping the communication dynamics within the system.
