# Payments

## Overview

The Payments section is primarily responsible for recording all the financial transactions made to the organization by clients. It organizes and displays this data in a tabular format for convenient management. The information captured typically includes the relevant project, invoice number, order number, payment amount, payment date, and the payment status. It also offers functionalities for editing, viewing, and deleting payment records. Additionally, the data can be filtered based on project names or payment status for ease of reference.
