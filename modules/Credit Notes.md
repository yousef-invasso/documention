# Credit Notes

## Overview

Credit Notes represent the amount of an invoice that is not refunded but rather recorded in the database. Clients can redeem these credit notes in their subsequent invoices or payments. Credit Notes are generated when a paid invoice is canceled for specific reasons, and instead of issuing a refund, the paid amount is converted into a credit note, which the client can utilize in future transactions.

## Adding Credit Notes

Credit Notes are added in this section by converting a paid invoice into a credit note. This conversion is initiated from the invoice page and is recorded directly in the Credit Notes page in a tabular format. The recorded data typically includes details such as Credit Note number, associated Invoice number, client name, total amount, Credit Note date, Credit Note status, and various additional options like editing, deletion, and more. You can also export this data for offline access by using the option provided in the top left corner of the data table.

## Viewing Credit Notes

Individual credit notes can be easily viewed by selecting the "View" option. This view provides information about both parties involved, the Credit Note number, associated Invoice number, date, and billing details, which were originally present on the corresponding invoice. Credit notes are typically redeemed in the next invoice, and the status of the credit note is adjusted accordingly based on this redemption.
