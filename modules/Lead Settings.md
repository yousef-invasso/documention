# Lead Settings

**Lead Settings** are crucial for managing potential customers (leads) effectively. These settings provide a structured approach for handling leads' queries and interactions before they become clients. Here's how they work:

- **Lead Source:** This defines the channels through which the organization accepts lead queries. It's important to identify the various sources where leads come from, such as websites, social media, or referrals.
- **Lead Status:** This category tracks the progress of lead queries. It allows the organization to update leads on the status of their queries, helping them understand how their request is being processed.
- **Lead Agents:** Lead agents are employees responsible for responding to lead queries. They play a crucial role in converting potential leads into clients by providing timely and helpful information.
- **Lead Category:** This feature categorizes lead queries into specific groups based on their nature or distribution. This segmentation helps in organizing and managing leads effectively.
