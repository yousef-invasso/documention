### 5. CHANGE LANGUAGE

Setting up a default language for the entire team's convenience and uniform communication can be configured from this section. It allows various language options to accommodate regional preferences.

### 6. CLIENT SIGN UP SETTINGS

This section manages client self-login settings. Admins can enable or disable the feature that allows clients to self-register and set up their accounts. Additionally, there is an option to require admin approval for client signups. Enabling this feature ensures that clients must await admin approval before accessing the workspace, while disabling it allows clients to begin using the application without prior approval.
