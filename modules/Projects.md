## Projects

A project is a carefully planned undertaking, conducted individually or collaboratively, designed to achieve a specific goal.

The Projects section under the Work Module primarily records all projects undertaken by the company for its clients. It includes project details such as team members, deadlines, clients, completion status, and various other options, such as editing, viewing the project as a Gantt Chart, archiving, and project deletion.
