# **Time Log Settings**

**Time Logging**Â a feature added in this system is mainly to track the time taken by individual tasks or projects as a whole for completion. It is necessary to start the timer and keep track of work using it. These settings permit the turning off of the timer after the office hours ends and also to check if the time logging activity should demand approval or not.
