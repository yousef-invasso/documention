# Project Settings

### Overview

Project Settings allow you to configure work reminders before the due date of assigned tasks. This feature enables you to send timely reminders to ensure tasks are completed on schedule. You have the option to enable or disable reminders and customize who receives them and how many days before the due date.

Enabling reminders is a helpful practice to promote timely task completion and prevent last-minute rush.
