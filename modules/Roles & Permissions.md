# Roles & Permissions

**Roles and Permissions** is a critical section of settings that governs the access rights of individuals within an organization. With a wide array of modules offering insights into organizational operations, it is essential to differentiate and regulate who can access what. This section provides comprehensive control over module accessibility for individuals.

Moreover, the "Manage Roles" option in this section allows organizations to create and customize new roles within their team, offering flexibility in tailoring access permissions.

It's important to note that administrators are granted unrestricted access, and their roles and permissions cannot be modified.

There are five primary permission types:

1. **ALL:** Provides full access to the permission.
2. **ADDED:** Grants access to records added by the user.
3. **OWNED:** Allows access to records assigned to the user or those owned by the user.
4. **ADDED & OWNED:** Combines both ADDED and OWNED permissions.
5. **NONE:** Offers no access to the permission.

Here are some use cases to clarify the permission types:

- To enable employees to view projects they are members of, assign OWNED permission type for "View Projects" permission to the employee role.
- To permit employees to view tasks they have created or assigned to themselves, assign ADDED & OWNED permission type for "View Tasks" permission to the employee role.
- To let clients view projects to which they are assigned as the client, assign OWNED permission type for "View Projects" permission in the Client role.
