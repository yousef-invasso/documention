# Contracts

## Contracts

A contract is a legally binding agreement that defines and governs the rights and duties between parties, involving the exchange of goods, services, money, or promises thereof.

The Contracts section under the WORK Module records all contracts signed between the company and various clients, parties, or organizations in the past. It organizes data for these contracts in a tabular format, including client name, amount, start date, end date, along with options for descriptive view, public link, copy contract, editing, deletion, and downloading of recorded contracts.
