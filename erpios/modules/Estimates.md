# Estimates

# Overview

Estimates are documents that outline the expected financial expenditures associated with a project presented to a client before its commencement. They serve as a platform for both parties to collaboratively decide, discuss, and negotiate the project's costs, ensuring transparency regarding products and their associated prices. This process helps prevent potential disputes by addressing all aspects of the project upfront.
