## Notice Board

A notice is a formal document that contains important and necessary information for all concerned members within an organization. The Notice Board is a dedicated space that centralizes all notices, making them easily accessible to all members. Notices are presented in a tabular format, providing a concise overview of each notice, including the Notice Heading, Issued Date, Members it is issued to, and additional features for editing and deletion.

When each notice is accessed individually, it redirects to a detailed view. Here, the issuer can see specific information, including the Notice Heading, Issued Date, Members it is issued to, and a Description/Purpose of the notice. There is also space to record which members have viewed the notice, visible only to the issuer of the notice.

### Adding New Notices

To add new notices to the Notice Board, users can utilize the "Add New Notice" option located in the top left corner. This option opens a pre-generated form with various sections that need to be completed when issuing a new notice:

1. **Checkboxes**: These allow users to specify if the notice is intended for employees or clients.
2. **Notice Heading**: This is a brief summary of the notice's content.
3. **Department**: This section is available only when the notice is intended for employees, allowing the issuer to specify which departments should receive the notice.
4. **Notice Details**: This is where detailed information is added to expand upon the notice's summary, providing comprehensive details for all members.

The Notice Board serves as a comprehensive information hub where important messages, updates, and announcements are shared with all relevant members. It ensures that critical information is effectively disseminated, reducing the likelihood of misunderstandings or miscommunication.
