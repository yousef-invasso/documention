# Invoices

## Overview

An invoice is a formal document issued by a seller to a buyer in a commercial transaction, detailing the products, quantities, and agreed prices for products or services provided by the seller. It also includes payment terms and instructions.

The Invoices section records all created invoices for various projects in a tabular format. This includes essential details like Invoice Number, Project Name, Client Name, Total Project Amount, Invoice Date, Payment Status. In addition, it provides various options such as descriptive view, downloading, sending invoices to clients, editing unpaid invoices, adding payments, generating payment links, sending payment reminders for unpaid invoices, creating credit notes for paid invoices, and deletion of the latest created invoice (please note that any invoice other than the latest one cannot be deleted).
