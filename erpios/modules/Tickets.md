### Overview

The Tickets module consolidates all details related to different issues and discussions in one organized space. The module starts with an overview section that displays statistics regarding the types of tickets handled by the organization. It includes numerical data on various categories:

- Total Tickets: The total number of tickets.
- Closed Tickets: Tickets that have been resolved and closed.
- Open Tickets: Tickets that are currently open and pending resolution.
- Pending Tickets: Tickets that are awaiting action or decision.
- Received Tickets: The total number of tickets received.

Beneath the numerical data, a tabular format displays all the received tickets, with columns for the ticket number, ticket subject, requester name, date of request, and other additional details. Users can conveniently filter and navigate through this list using filter features or tabs that categorize the tickets.

### Creating Tickets

To add a new received ticket to the existing list, a "Create Ticket" form must be filled out. The form includes several fields:

### Customizing Ticket Forms

The "Create Ticket Form" can be customized to suit the organization's specific needs. Fields can be added or removed as required. The ability to customize the form is essential for ensuring that the ticket creation process aligns with the organization's unique requirements.

After making selections or modifications, a preview form is available to review the changes before finalizing the form. This flexibility allows organizations to adapt the ticket creation process to their specific workflow and data collection needs.

The Tickets module plays a vital role in addressing and resolving issues and concerns raised by both employees and clients. By efficiently managing and resolving tickets, organizations can make significant improvements in their operations and customer service.
