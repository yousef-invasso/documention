# Expenses

## Overview

Expenses refer to the additional expenditures that employees make in the course of completing tasks or projects on behalf of the organization. This section serves as a record for the expense data submitted by employees for potential reimbursement. The recorded data is organized in a tabular format, typically including information such as item name, price, employee details, purchase source, purchase date, status, and various additional options like viewing, editing, and deletion.

## Adding Expenses

To record an expense, you can use the "Add Expense" option located at the top left corner. This option opens a pre-generated form where employees can input essential details about the expense and await approval from the organization for reimbursement. An expense typically includes basic information and may include a billing document for record-keeping. Once the organization approves the expense, the reimbursed amount is paid to the employee in their next salary payment or as per the organization's established process.
