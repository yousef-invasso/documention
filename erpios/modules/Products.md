## Overview

The Products section holds a list of generic products or services offered by the company, which can be directly purchased by clients based on their requirements. These services can also be added to specific projects taken up by clients, and an invoice is generated for every product purchase.

### Managing Product List

The list of offered products can be edited as per organizational requirements from the Settings section under the admin account.
