# Time Logs

## Time Logs

The Time Logs panel within the Work Module focuses on recording the time required for individual tasks, which is stored in the database and later contributes to calculating the total time logged for each project. This section is essential for calculating average task completion times when generating reports for analysis.

### Logging Time

In the top left corner, there is a "Log Time" section, allowing you to log time for both new and previously created tasks.

When logging time, you'll need to provide the following basic details:

- **Project name**
- **Task name**
- **Employee name**
- **Start date and time**
- **End date and time**
- Additional information as needed

The logged information is displayed in a tabular format in the final list, making it easy to track and analyze.
