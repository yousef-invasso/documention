### **Change/Reset Estimate Numbers**

Estimate numbers are auto-incremental. The CRM increases the invoice ID by one digit, every time a new invoice is created.

You can manually change the next estimate ID via the steps shown below.

The number that you specify is what will be used to create the next estimate ID.

In the event that you want to reset or start over from invoice **ID: 0001**, you must first delete all estimates in the CRM and then change the number shown in the steps below, to **1**.

### **Estimate Statuses**

When you create a new estimate,  it is given a status of **“Draft”**. This status means that the estimatehas not been yet been emailed to your client and it is not visible in the client’s CRM dashboard.

Once you are ready to send the estimate to the client, you must **“Publish”** it, using the button shown below.

On **publishing** the estimate, an email is automatically sent to the client

The estimate will also become visible to the client, in their CRM dashboard.

Once an invoice has been published, its status will automatically change to **“New”** status.

**Changing Estimates Statuses**

The system automatically determines the correct status to give an estimate, based on the actions taken by the client (i.e. **Accepted** or **Declined**).

You can also change the status **manually**, as shown in the image below.

    - Example **EST-** will create invoices as follows: **EST-000276**
