# Recurring Invoices

Owner: yousef badr

Recurring invoices allow you to bill your customers automatically, on a regular basis.

To create recurring invoices, you must first create a **regular invoice**. This will act as the **first** invoice that your customer will receive and it will also act as a template for all future/automatic invoices.

Once you have created your regular invoice, you can make it recurring as shown below

**(1)** Click on the recurring invoices icon and select **Recurring Settings**

**(2)** & **(3)** Set how often the invoice should recur. If for example, you want the invoice to repeat every month, select 1 & month

**(4)** The **cycle** determine how many times the invoice should recur. If you want it to recur indefinitely, set the value to 0

**(5)** The **next invoice date**, tells the application when it should start creating the recurring invoices. For example, if your invoice is recurring every month, then this date should be 1 month from the date that you created the initial/regular invoice.
