# **Estimates Overview**

Clients are reluctant to commission a project when the cost is unknown. This is where cost estimates can help you generate more work. Estimates help the client to understand what sort of budget is required for the work that they want to be undertaken.

**CRM** enables you to create estimates, which you can use to better convert your leads into customers.

The best place to start is the Estimates page.

- **Publishing An Estimate**
